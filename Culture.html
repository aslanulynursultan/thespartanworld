                    <p>The culture of Sparta and the Spartans was pinpoint focused upon their military, they were a highly efficient unit on and off the battlefield.
                     The only truly military state in ancient Greece, Spartans, men, women and children were born into, 
                     and lived in an existence that was ruled by regiment and organisation. It was this military regimented mentality that allowed the small
                     Spartan population to become rulers of ancient Greece and the dominant fighting force of the time.
                    </p>  
                    <br>
                    <p>The Spartan society was based on the constitution and was ruled by a mixed state of government which worked using quite a complicated system, 
                        but this essentially consisted of two kings from two separate families. 
                        The kings were considered equal in power and their dual rulership was designed to ensure fairness and harmony in the state.
                        This dual kingship was rather unique and not repeated anywhere in ancient Greece except Sparta,
                        but this feature proved extremely popular throughout the timeline of ancient Sparta.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The culture of Ancient Sparta is not very diverse. People who were unable to engage in military affairs were despised. 
                        The occupation of art, writing, philosophy was ridiculed. The population was illiterate, 
                        and even though reading and writing were taught in military schools, future soldiers could skip lessons for the sake of honing their physical strength.
                         The only element of culture was patriotic songs. 
                        They were memorized and sung during the military campaign.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <P>
                     Not everyone was allowed to perform patriotic songs. The words in these songs are quite simple, but each phrase is aimed at raising a person's fighting mood.
                     Religion was an important indicator of culture. The Spartans believed in ancient Greek gods. Without a religious cult, not a single campaign was made,
                     and not a single battle began. Before the battle, a sacrifice was made to the gods so that they would be on the side of the warriors during the battle.
                     After the end of the battle, regardless of the results, religious praise was given to the gods.
                    </P>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Spartan women had a reputation for being independent-minded, and enjoyed more freedoms and power than their counterparts throughout ancient Greece. While they played no role in the military, female Spartans often received a formal education, although separate from boys and not at boarding schools.</li>
                            <li>In part to attract mates, females engaged in athletic competitions, including javelin-throwing and wrestling, and also sang and danced competitively. As adults, Spartan women were allowed to own and manage property. Additionally, they were typically unencumbered by domestic responsibilities such as cooking, cleaning and making clothing, tasks which were handled by the Helots.</li>
                            <li>Marriage was important to Spartans, as the state put pressure on people to have male children who would grow up to become citizen-warriors, and to replace those who died in battle. Men who delayed marriage were publicly shamed, while those who fathered multiple sons could be rewarded.</li>
