                    <p>Mystras, the ‘wonder of the Morea’, lies in the southeast of the Peloponnese. The town developed down the hillside from the fortress built in 1249 by the prince of Achaia, William II of Villehardouin, at the top of a 620 m high hill overlooking Sparta. The Franks surrendered the castle to the Byzantines in 1262, it was the centre of Byzantine power in southern Greece, first as the base of the military governor and from 1348 as the seat of the Despotate of Morea. Captured by the Turks in 1460, it was occupied thereafter by them and the Venetians. After 1834 the inhabitants of Mystras gradually started to move to the modern town of Sparta leaving only the breath-taking medieval ruins, standing in a beautiful landscape.</p>

                    <h1>Leonidas Monument</h1>
                    <img src="images/the-statue1.jpg" width="700" height="320" alt="">

                    <p>The Leonidas Monument is one of the most impressive monuments in Sparta, Greece. It’s an iconic structure that has been standing for more than 2,500 years, and it commemorates Leonidas, who died during the battle against Xerxes I of Persia. The monument was built on the 300th anniversary of the death of Leonidas.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The Leonidas Monument is a huge three-layered limestone structure. The first layer has 60 fluted Doric columns with 18 on each side, the second one has 96 fluted Ionic columns with 22 on each side, and the last one has 16 Corinthian-style pillars with 8 on each side.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The magnificent monument stands at an impressive height of 35 meters tall. Also, it has a diameter of 30 meters at its base, and the top side is 17 meters wide. The Leonidas Monument was built on the site where Leonidas’ body was cremated after he died during the battle against Xerxes I of Persia. The monument looks very similar to the Parthenon in Athens, but it’s smaller in size.
                    Leonidas Monument is made of limestone, and the construction process started in 478-479 B.C., several years after Leonidas died. The monument was funded by the Peloponnesian League, an alliance that Sparta formed with other city-states during the fifth century BC.</p>

                    <img src="images/acropolis-and-ancient3.jpg" width="350" height="250" alt="">  
                    <p>The Acropolis is at the north end of town, just beyond the statue of Leonidas near the supposed site of his tomb. The grove of trees makes the Acropolis a pleasant place to sit at sunset, but you'll probably enjoy the view of Taygetos more than the remains of the 2nd-century-B.C. theater. Originally, this was one of the largest theaters in Greece, seating 16,000. The theater was dismantled and the blocks were carted off for reuse when the Franks built Mistra in the 13th century. The theater is sometimes used during the summer festival that, funding permitting, Sparta sometimes has.</p>
